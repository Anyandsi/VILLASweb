                Welcome to <b>SLEW</b>!
            </p>
            <p>SLEW is a learning platform for running experiments in a virtual power engineering world.
                The platform enables interaction with the experiments in real time and performing analysis on the experimental results.</p>

            <p>The motivation behind SLEW is the ongoing transformation of the energy system, which is making the system more and more complex.
            Hence, understanding new phenomena and underlying interactions is getting more challenging, also because real experimental
            activities for obtaining a better understanding are not possible for obvious reasons of security and safety.</p>

            <p>The SLEW platform gives the possibility to perform experiments in a virtual infrastructure and to learn from the execution
            of complex models. It provides a virtual power engineering world where complex phenomena take place while users can interact
                    with the system in real time.</p>

            <p>The platform is based on the real-time simulation tool DPsim developed in RWTH,
            which is available as open-source software project to the power engineering community. Besides, it integrates the interactive
                    computing environment Jupyter for further analysis of experimental results.</p>
